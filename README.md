# AIPRATool: AI Privacy Risk Assessment Tool

## Overview

AIPRATool is a modular questionnaire-based proof of concept designed to help organisations assess privacy risks in Multi-Agent AI systems. It uses a structured, explainable approach grounded in privacy governance frameworks, supporting early risk identification in complex, evolving AI environments.

---

## Contents

-   **Proof of Concept:**  
    A web-based questionnaire built with Tally.so for initial validation and stakeholder use.

-   **System Framing:**  
    Conceptual design showing how privacy governance principles can guide AI risk assessment through structured tools.

---

## Research Context

AI introduces dynamic privacy risks across sectors. AIPRATool bridges technical and governance gaps by integrating NIST Privacy Framework, CFIP, and Adaptive Enterprise Architecture into a unified Privacy Risk Classification Framework (PRCF). This enables organisations to better understand and manage AI privacy risks.

## Future Work

-   Add intelligent agents for reasoning and recommendations
-   Multi-agent orchestration for comprehensive privacy functions
-   Support for additional frameworks (e.g., GDPR, ISO 27701)
-   Enterprise integrations (APIs, compliance platform plug-ins)
