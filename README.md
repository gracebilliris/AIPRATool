# AIQPRATool: AI and Quantum Privacy Risk Assessment Tool

## Overview

This repository contains the initial prototype and the proposed system architecture for the AI and Quantum Privacy Risk Assessment Tool (AIQPRATool), developed as part of Grace Billiris's PhD research.

The tool aims to provide a modular, agent-based framework for privacy risk assessment in AI and quantum computing systems, with explainable and adaptive governance capabilities. With the convergence of AI and quantum technologies, new data privacy challenges emerge that require innovative, scalable solutions.

## Contents

-   **Prototype:**  
    A web-based privacy risk assessment tool implemented using Tally.so, serving as an early-stage validation platform for organisations to assess privacy risks in AI and quantum systems.
-   **Proposed System Architecture:**  
    Detailed design and description of the future multi-agent system architecture that supports intelligent, scalable privacy risk governance with semantic reasoning and policy compliance agents.

---

## Research Context

This work addresses critical challenges in managing privacy risks for emerging AI and quantum computing technologies, integrating semantic reasoning, policy compliance agents, and explainable assessments to empower organisations with contextual privacy risk insights.

## Future Work

-   Transition to a modular multi-agent architecture, as detailed in the `system-architecture/` folder.
-   Integration with AI APIs for natural language processing and explanation generation.
-   Incorporation of distributed ledger technologies for tamper-proof audit trails.
-   Implementation of quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques to secure future systems.
