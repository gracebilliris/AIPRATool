### Technical Architecture of the AIPRA Tool

The AIPRA Tool is a web-based privacy risk assessment proof of concept developed as a Proof of Concept (PoC) that operationalises the Privacy Risk Classification Framework (PRCF) to evaluate privacy risks in AI and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Its architecture is designed to support usability, framework fidelity, and extensibility toward a future multi-agent privacy governance system.

#### Key Components

1. **Users**  
   Individuals and teams (e.g., compliance officers, software engineers, researchers, data governance professionals) who engage with the tool through a guided series of ten multiple-choice questions based on PRCF principles.

2. **Admin**  
   Administrators managing tool operations, user access, security, and ongoing maintenance to ensure reliability and incorporate user feedback.

3. **Interface**  
   A user-friendly web interface facilitating intuitive interaction and adaptive question flows to enhance usability and clarity in privacy risk assessments.

4. **Tally.so Platform**  
   The no-code form-building platform hosting the tool, enabling flexible question logic, branching, and data export capabilities for analysis and auditing.

5. **Research & Analysis Knowledge Base**  
   A dynamic, evolving knowledge base that synthesises academic research, policy standards, and best practices to inform the question bank, scoring logic, and categorisation schema. This component ensures the tool remains current with emerging privacy risks and technologies.

#### Assessment Logic

-   The tool implements two targeted questions for each of the five PRCF principles, with three response levels (High, Moderate, Low) mapped to risk indicators.
-   Responses generate a cumulative interpretive privacy risk profile highlighting high-exposure areas, strengths, and actionable recommendations aligned with privacy best practices.
-   The tiered response model balances governance, technical controls, user-centric values, and continuous improvement.

#### Multi-Agent Architecture (Planned for Future Phases)

1. **Input/Output Layer**  
   User interface for gathering inputs and displaying interpretive feedback.

2. **Coordinating Agent**  
   Plans and executes actions, manages short-term memory, and interfaces with structured/unstructured data via caches, vector databases, and knowledge graphs.

3. **Policy Compliance Agent**  
   Validates privacy policy compliance and risk logic using an independent execution loop with short-term memory.

4. **Explanation Agent**  
   Generates interpretable summaries and justifications leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.

5. **Processing & Orchestration Layer**  
   Coordinates event-driven workflows, manages agent task orchestration, and interfaces with large language models (LLMs) for natural language reasoning.

6. **Memory & Knowledge Base**  
   An information layer including cached data, structured/unstructured sources, a vector database for semantic retrieval, and a knowledge graph for contextual reasoning.

This modular, layered architecture underpins the AIPRA toolâ€™s capability to deliver comprehensive, actionable privacy risk assessments and serves as the foundation for scalable, intelligent, multi-agent privacy governance solutions.
