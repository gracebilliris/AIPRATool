# Technical Details of AIPRATool Proof of Concept

This document outlines the technical implementation of the AI Privacy Risk Assessment Tool (AIPRATool) proof of concept.

## Platform

-   Developed using **Tally.so**, a no-code/low-code web form platform.
-   Enables rapid deployment and easy access for early validation and stakeholder engagement.

## Architecture and Features

-   Comprises a **static questionnaire** covering core privacy risk domains aligned with the PRCF framework.
-   Users manually select responses; risk scoring is calculated within the form using predefined logic.
-   Provides a summary risk overview upon completion to highlight potential privacy concerns.

## Limitations

-   **Automation:** No support for automated data ingestion or external system integration at this stage.
-   **Scalability:** Intended for small-scale, proof-of-concept use and early feedback collection.
-   **Interactivity:** Fixed question set with no adaptive or dynamic flows.
-   **Data Storage:** Responses are managed by Tally.so; data control remains with the platform provider.

## Future Technical Directions

-   Transition to a **modular, multi-agent architecture** featuring:

    -   Automated data input and real-time privacy risk assessment via specialised agents.
    -   AI-driven natural language processing for explanation generation and user guidance using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
    -   Dynamic orchestration layer coordinating agent workflows and managing large language model (LLM) interactions.
    -   Integration with distributed ledger technology to provide immutable audit trails and enhance compliance verification.

-   Expansion of framework support enabling users to toggle or combine privacy standards (e.g., GDPR, ISO 27701) seamlessly within the system.

-   Development and deployment on cloud platforms (e.g., Azure, Google Cloud) leveraging AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI) to support scalability and advanced intelligent features.

-   Implementation of persistent memory and knowledge base components including vector databases and knowledge graphs to facilitate semantic retrieval and contextual reasoning.

## Data Privacy and Security

-   Data collection complies with ethical standards; no sensitive or personally identifiable data is retained beyond Tally.so.
-   Future iterations will embed strong privacy-preserving and security controls aligned with regulatory requirements.
