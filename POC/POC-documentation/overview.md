# AI Privacy Risk Assessment Tool (AIPRA) Proof of Concept Overview

## Introduction

The AIPRA Tool proof of concept is a web-based privacy risk assessment tool developed using Tally.so. It offers a structured questionnaire to help organisations evaluate key privacy risks associated with their Multi-Agent AI systems. This proof of concept supports early validation of the underlying privacy risk assessment framework and invites feedback from stakeholders to improve future iterations.

## Purpose

-   To guide users through assessing privacy governance, data practices, and privacy control mechanisms in Multi-Agent AI systems.
-   To provide a clear, understandable privacy risk scoring based on user responses.
-   To demonstrate the feasibility and usability of a lightweight, questionnaire-based privacy risk assessment tool.

## Features

-   **System Type Selection:** Users select the type of system they are assessing (AI), with accompanying definitions to ensure clarity.
-   **Governance & Risk Management:** Questions examine organisational processes for privacy oversight and risk reviews.
-   **Privacy Risk Assessment:** Identifies the use of personal data and risks such as re-identification or inference.
-   **Privacy Controls Implementation:** Assesses the deployment of privacy-preserving measures such as encryption or minimisation.
-   **User-Centric Privacy Considerations:** Evaluates transparency features, consent mechanisms, and user control options.
-   **Continuous Monitoring & Improvement:** Reviews the presence of audit processes and update cycles for privacy governance.

## Limitations

-   The proof of concept is currently limited by the functionality of the Tally.so platform.
-   It depends on manual user input and does not yet support automation or dynamic data analysis.
-   Risk scoring is static and based only on questionnaire responses—there is no adaptive reasoning or AI integration at this stage.
-   The tool is not intended to serve as a formal compliance system; results should be interpreted as guidance for privacy risk awareness.

## Usage Instructions

1. Access the tool via the [AIPRA Tool proof of concept URL](https://tally.so/r/npMbGB).
2. Select the system type for assessment.
3. Respond to each question based on your organisation’s current privacy posture.
4. Review the final privacy risk score and note potential areas for improvement.
5. Optionally, provide feedback to support the enhancement of future versions.

## Future Enhancements (Planned)

-   Improve customisability and reporting capabilities based on user feedback.
-   Explore integration of AI techniques (e.g., natural language explanations or adaptive feedback).
-   Investigate secure storage and audit features, including tamper-evident records.
-   Assess compatibility with privacy standards and frameworks for interoperability.
-   Consider future cryptographic enhancements, including quantum-resistant options.
