# AIQPRA Tool System Architecture Description

## Overview

The AIQPRA Tool system is designed as a **modular multi-agent architecture** that supports comprehensive privacy risk assessment for AI, Quantum Computing, and Quantum AI (QAI) systems. This architecture facilitates integration of various privacy frameworks, automation of data collection and analysis, and dynamic risk scoring.

## Components

### 1. User Interface Agent

-   Provides an interactive front-end for users to input system data and view assessment results.
-   Supports accessibility and usability enhancements.

### 2. Data Collection Agent

-   Automates gathering of system metadata, logs, and relevant documentation.
-   Interfaces with APIs, databases, and other enterprise systems.

### 3. Privacy Risk Assessment Agent

-   Implements the Unified Privacy Risk Classification Framework (PRCF) based on NIST, CFIP, and Adaptive Enterprise Architecture models.
-   Applies AI/ML techniques to evaluate privacy risks quantitatively and qualitatively.

### 4. Knowledge Base Agent

-   Maintains up-to-date privacy regulations, standards, and best practices.
-   Supports adaptive assessment by incorporating new privacy research and compliance requirements.

### 5. Reporting and Recommendations Agent

-   Generates risk reports, mitigation suggestions, and compliance checklists.
-   Supports export and integration with governance tools.

## Interactions and Workflow

-   Users initiate assessments through the User Interface Agent.
-   Data Collection Agent gathers relevant information with user consent.
-   Privacy Risk Assessment Agent analyzes data using the PRCF model.
-   Knowledge Base Agent provides context and updates to the assessment logic.
-   Reporting Agent delivers actionable insights back to the user.

## Design Rationale

-   **Modularity:** Facilitates incremental development and integration of new features.
-   **Scalability:** Designed to handle complex enterprise systems and evolving privacy landscapes.
-   **Transparency:** Supports explainability of AI-driven assessments.
-   **Adaptability:** Enables ongoing updates to frameworks and privacy knowledge.
