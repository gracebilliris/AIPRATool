# AIQPRA Tool Prototype User Guide

Welcome to the AI and Quantum Privacy Risk Assessment (AIQPRA) Tool prototype! This guide will help you navigate and effectively use the web-based assessment tool.

## Getting Started

1. **Access the Tool**  
   Visit the prototype at [https://tally.so/r/npMbGB](https://tally.so/r/npMbGB).

2. **Select System Type**  
   Choose one of the system types you are assessing:

    - **AI System:** Machine intelligence simulations (learning, reasoning, decision-making).
    - **Quantum Computing System:** Uses quantum phenomena for advanced computation.
    - **Quantum AI (QAI) System:** Hybrid of AI and quantum computing for enhanced capabilities.

3. **Complete the Assessment Questions**  
   The tool will guide you through a series of questions grouped into five categories:

    - Governance & Risk Management
    - Privacy Risk Assessment
    - Privacy Controls Implementation
    - User-Centric Privacy Considerations
    - Continuous Monitoring & Improvement

    For each question, select the option that best reflects your current system practices.

## Understanding the Results

-   After completing the questionnaire, you will receive a **privacy risk score** indicating potential areas of concern.
-   Scores are intended as **general guidance** to inform prioritisation of privacy risk mitigation efforts.
-   The tool does not provide legal or compliance certifications but supports awareness and early risk identification.

## Tips for Effective Use

-   Answer questions as accurately as possible based on your current system and policies.
-   Use the tool regularly to track improvements and changes in privacy risk posture.
-   Engage relevant stakeholders in completing the assessment to ensure comprehensive insights.

## Limitations

-   This prototype relies on manual input and a static questionnaire interface.
-   It does not support automated data collection or continuous monitoring.
-   Results should be interpreted with caution and supplemented with expert advice where necessary.
