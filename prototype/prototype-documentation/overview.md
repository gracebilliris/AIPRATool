# AI and Quantum Privacy Risk Assessment Tool (AIQPRA) Prototype Overview

## Introduction

The AIQPRA Tool prototype is a web-based privacy risk assessment tool developed using Tally.so. It provides a structured questionnaire to help organisations evaluate the privacy risks associated with their AI, Quantum Computing (QC), and Quantum AI (QAI) systems. The prototype aims to facilitate early validation of the proposed privacy risk assessment framework and engage stakeholders for feedback.

## Purpose

-   To guide users through assessing privacy governance, data management, and privacy controls.
-   To provide a clear, understandable risk scoring based on user input.
-   To demonstrate the feasibility of the modular, agent-based architecture proposed for scalable privacy risk assessment.

## Features

-   **System Type Selection:** Users select the type of system they are assessing (AI, QC, or QAI), with definitions provided to clarify terms.
-   **Governance & Risk Management Questions:** Evaluate the frequency and effectiveness of privacy governance and risk reviews.
-   **Privacy Risk Assessment:** Identify personal data usage and risks of re-identification or inference.
-   **Privacy Controls Implementation:** Check adoption of privacy-preserving techniques like encryption and differential privacy.
-   **User-Centric Privacy Considerations:** Assess transparency and user control mechanisms.
-   **Continuous Monitoring & Improvement:** Evaluate update frequency and audit processes for ongoing privacy assurance.

## Limitations

-   The prototype is limited by the functionality of the Tally.so platform.
-   It relies on manual input without automation or real-time data integration.
-   Risk scoring is based on static questionnaire responses without adaptive reasoning.
-   Not intended for use as a definitive compliance tool—results serve as guidance.

## Usage Instructions

-   Access the tool via the [provided URL](https://tally.so/r/npMbGB).
-   Select the system type to assess.
-   Answer each question honestly based on your system’s current privacy practices.
-   Review the resulting risk score and identify areas needing improvement.
-   Provide feedback or suggest enhancements to improve future versions.

## Future Enhancements (Planned)

-   Transition to a modular agent-based system with automated data integration.
-   Incorporate AI-driven natural language processing for explanation generation.
-   Add adaptive learning to refine risk assessments based on audit outcomes.
-   Integrate distributed ledger technology for audit trail immutability.
-   Explore quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques for enhanced security.
