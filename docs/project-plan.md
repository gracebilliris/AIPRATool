# Project Plan: AIQPRA Tool Development

## Project Objectives

-   Develop a privacy risk assessment tool tailored for AI, Quantum Computing, and QAI systems.
-   Integrate multiple privacy frameworks (NIST, CFIP, AEA) into a unified risk classification.
-   Create a prototype to validate assessment questions and methodology.
-   Evolve the prototype into a modular multi-agent system for automated privacy risk analysis.

## Milestones and Timeline

| Milestone                  | Description                                    | Due Date    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Literature Review          | Comprehensive review of privacy risks in AI/QC | Completed   |
| Prototype Development      | Create initial Tally.so-based questionnaire    | Completed   |
| System Architecture Design | Define multi-agent system and workflows        | In Progress |
| Prototype Documentation    | Prepare detailed docs and user guides          | Ongoing     |

## Resources

-   Research papers and academic literature on AI and quantum privacy risks.
-   Collaboration with privacy experts and PhD supervisors.
-   Cloud and AI development platforms for future tool iterations.

## Risks and Mitigation

-   **Technical Complexity:** Incremental development and modular design.
-   **Data Sensitivity:** Use anonymised data and ethical compliance.
-   **Framework Evolution:** Maintain flexibility in design for framework updates.
