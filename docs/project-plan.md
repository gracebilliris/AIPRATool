# Project Plan: AIPRA Tool Development

## Project Objectives

-   Develop a privacy risk assessment proof of concept tailored for Multi-Agent AI systems.
-   Integrate NIST, CFIP, and AEA privacy frameworks into a unified Privacy Risk Classification Framework (PRCF).
-   Validate assessment questions through a modular, questionnaire-based tool.
-   Lay groundwork for future modular, agent-oriented automation and AI-driven privacy risk analysis.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Literature Review

-   Conduct a systematic review of AI privacy risks and privacy frameworks using PRISMA methodology.
-   Identify key assessment domains aligned to PRCF categories.
-   Complete comprehensive literature synthesis.

### Phase 2: Proof-of-Concept Development

-   Design and deploy an initial questionnaire using Tally.so, aligned with PRCF.
-   Develop and validate 10 assessment questions mapped to NIST, CFIP, and AEA.
-   Collect expert feedback and conduct pilot testing for usability and clarity.

### Phase 3: Conceptual Architecture Planning

-   Define high-level, modular system architecture for future automation and multi-agent support.
-   Emphasise explainability, transparency, and user-centric design principles.
-   Plan integration points for data sources, policy repositories, and AI reasoning modules.

### Phase 4: Documentation & Evaluation

-   Produce user guides, explanatory documentation, and design artefacts.
-   Conduct usability testing and iterative refinement based on feedback.
-   Map assessment questions and outputs explicitly to PRCF framework components.

### Phase 5: Future Expansion (Planned)

-   Explore automation of data inputs and AI agents for enhanced privacy risk scoring.
-   Support multiple assessment frameworks independently or combined (e.g., NIST-only, CFIP-only).
-   Develop dashboard and reporting features aimed at enterprise deployment.

## Resources

-   Peer-reviewed literature and industry reports on AI privacy risks.
-   Collaboration with privacy experts, academic advisors, and enterprise stakeholders.
-   Low-code/no-code platforms enabling rapid development.

## Risks and Mitigation

-   **Technical Complexity:** Use incremental, modular development to manage scope.
-   **Data Sensitivity:** Adhere strictly to ethical standards, ensuring anonymised inputs and secure data handling.
-   **Framework Updates:** Maintain flexible design to accommodate evolving privacy standards.
