# Research Methodology

## Overview

The development of AIPRATool employs a design science approach that integrates a systematic literature review, iterative proof-of-concept development, and conceptual architectural framing. This ensures the tool is both theoretically grounded and practically aligned to address emerging privacy risks in AI.

## Systematic Literature Review

-   Conducted a structured review following PRISMA guidelines, analysing 67 academic and industry sources focused on AI privacy risks.
-   Explored key themes including transparency, consent, governance, accountability, and user trust.
-   Mapped identified risks and mitigation strategies to three foundational frameworks: NIST Privacy Framework, Concern for Information Privacy (CFIP), and Adaptive Enterprise Architecture (AEA).
-   Synthesised findings into the Unified Privacy Risk Classification Framework (PRCF), which underpins the toolâ€™s structure.

## Tool and Questionnaire Development

-   Developed a web-based proof of concept using Tally.so, inspired by existing assessment tools like the Copyright Risk Checker (CRC).
-   Created 10 multiple-choice questions grouped into five PRCF domains:
    -   **Governance & Risk Management**
    -   **Privacy Risk Assessment**
    -   **Privacy Controls Implementation**
    -   **User-Centric Privacy Considerations**
    -   **Continuous Monitoring & Improvement**
-   Collaborated with AI governance and privacy experts to validate question clarity, relevance, and usability.

## Conceptual System Design

-   Designed a modular and extensible architecture to support future integration with data sources, policy repositories, and AI-driven explanation features.
-   While the current proof of concept does not include automation or multi-agent capabilities, the framework anticipates these enhancements.
-   Prioritised accessibility and transparency to accommodate both technical and non-technical users.

## Data Collection and Preliminary Analysis

-   Conducted usability testing through manual response collection from early users.
-   Incorporated user feedback to refine the interface and validate question design.
-   Future iterations aim to introduce semi-automated data capture and analytics for improved scalability and precision.

## Ethical and Compliance Considerations

-   All research activities complied with university human ethics requirements.
-   Informed consent was obtained, ensuring confidentiality and anonymity.
-   The tool is for educational and awareness purposes only and does not store or process sensitive personal data.
