# Research Methodology

## Overview

The AIQPRA Tool development follows a mixed-methods research approach combining systematic literature review, prototype development, and architectural design.

## Systematic Literature Review

-   Utilised PRISMA methodology to identify, screen, and synthesise relevant studies.
-   Focused on privacy risks in AI, Quantum Computing, and QAI.
-   Analysed existing privacy frameworks (NIST, CFIP, AEA) for applicability and integration.

## Prototype Development

-   Created an initial questionnaire-based prototype using Tally.so.
-   Developed assessment questions aligned with the Unified Privacy Risk Classification Framework (PRCF).
-   Validated question clarity and coverage through expert feedback.

## Architectural Design

-   Designed a multi-agent system to support future automation and scalability.
-   Components designed for modularity and integration with evolving privacy knowledge.
-   Emphasis on explainability and user-centric privacy considerations.

## Data Collection and Analysis

-   Manual input via the prototype questionnaire for initial validation.
-   Future plans for automated data collection agents and AI-based risk analysis.

## Ethical Considerations

-   Ensured participant anonymity and data confidentiality.
-   Complied with institutional ethical guidelines for research.

This methodology ensures a rigorous, iterative development aligned with PhD research goals.
